This repository contains the material (notebooks, data) for the pandas tutorial at EuroScipy 2015.

## Requirements to run this tutorial

To follow this tutorial you need to have the following packages installed:


- Python version 2.6-2.7 or 3.3-3.4
- `pandas` version 0.15.2 or later: http://pandas.pydata.org/
- `numpy` version 1.7 or later: http://www.numpy.org/
- `matplotlib` version 1.3 or later: http://matplotlib.org/
- `ipython` version 3.x with notebook support, or `ipython 4.x` combined with `jupyter`: http://ipython.org
- `seaborn` (this is used for some plotting, but not necessary to follow the tutorial): http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/

I recommend to use the [conda](https://store.continuum.io/) environment manager to install all the requirements 
(you can install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) or install the (very large) Anaconda software
distribution, found at http://continuum.io/downloads).

Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment:
```
conda install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib jupyter seaborn
```

But of course, using another distribution (e.g. Enthought Canopy) or pip is good as well, as long
as you have the above packages installed.


## Downloading the tutorial materials

If you have git installed, you can get the material in this tutorial by cloning this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/2015-EuroScipy-pandas-tutorial.git

As an alternative, you can download it as a zip file:
https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche/2015-EuroScipy-pandas-tutorial/archive/master.zip.
I will probably make some changes until the start of the tutorial, so best to download
the latest version then (or do a `git pull` if you are using git).
